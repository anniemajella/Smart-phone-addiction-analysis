# Smart-phone-addiction-analysis

The excessive use of smartphones has become a significant concern among college students. This project aimed to analyze smartphone usage patterns and identify potential addiction behaviors among students at Loyola College.
Data was collected using Google Forms, which included questions about smartphone usage, screen time, and addiction-related behaviors. Responses from Loyola College students were collected over a specific period.
The collected data underwent a thorough cleansing process to handle outliers and inconsistencies. This ensured the quality and reliability of the dataset for further analysis.
To gain insights into different smartphone usage patterns, the data was clustered into two distinct groups using clustering algorithms. This helped identify students with similar usage behaviors.
# Data Visualization
# New dataset
A new dataset was constructed from the existing data, creating a final CSV file. This final dataset serves as the foundation for data visualization and analysis.
The final dataset was visualized using data visualization tool MICROSOFT POWER BI to explore and analyze smartphone addiction patterns. Visualizations included bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to provide insights into usage patterns.
# Result
The result was surprisingly found that the addicted students had less academic issues when compared to non-addicted students. 
# Acknowledgment
Special thanks to the students of Loyola College who participated in the data collection.
